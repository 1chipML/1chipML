# Code of conduct

The 1chipML community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all 1chipML spaces. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the 1chipML maintainers team. All participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

# Reporting Code of Conduct Issues

This community is encouraged to resolve issues on its own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting conduct@lfai.foundation. In your report please include:
1. Your contact information.
2. Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
3. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.
4. Any additional information that may be helpful.

All reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.
