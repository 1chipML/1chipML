\chapter{What is 1chipML?}

\section{Introduction}

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing (EC) are, nowadays, topics of high interest since
it is becoming clear that important advantages could emerge from this new sort of    technologies.
What kind of hardware will be in use in this context is still work in progress         since many
different directions are currently being explored.

In more details, one can consider the IoT as an ensemble        of computing objects with sensors,
embedded software, etc., which can connect and exchange data with other devices over the Internet
(or, equivalently, other communication networks). A continuously growing number of    IoT devices
are already being created for connected vehicles, home automation, wearable technology, and   all
sort of appliances with remote monitoring capabilities.         For instance, in industry, we are
witnessing the creation of a growing number of IoT devices       to acquire and analyze data from
connected equipment, operational technology, locations, and people.      Combined with monitoring
devices, this new technological paradigm is helping to regulate and monitor industrial    systems.
The same approach can be applied for automated record updates    of asset placement in industrial
storage units. Another important example of IoT is represented by the  Internet of Medical Things
(IoMT) which can be considered as an application of the IoT for medical and        health related
purposes. This novel technology can help in the creation         of a digitized healthcare system,
connecting available medical resources and healthcare services.

Edge computing is a growing and relevant approach as well, but very different than the IoT.    In
practice, the aim of edge computing is to move the computation away from data centers towards the
edge of the network, exploiting smart objects, mobile phones,      or network gateways to perform
tasks and provide services on behalf of the cloud.      Therefore, it also can be considered as a
distributed computing  paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of
data. In other words, one can consider the EC as any type of computer   program which can deliver
low latency nearer to the requests. Thus, this new computing approach is expected     to speed up
response times and save bandwidth since it is possible to provide content caching,        service
delivery, persistent data storage,      and IoT management resulting in better response times and
transfer rates.

Obviously, the sort of hardware needed to implement these two approaches cannot solely    rely on
classical computing devices such as servers, Beowulf clusters, etc.      since they require those
devices to be fast, low power demanding and in small packages. One technology approach that seems
to be currently emerging is based on the use of microcontrollers (MCUs). While this seems to be a
promising direction, it obviously comes with new challenges which needs to be addressed.    Among
these open problems, one that seems to be relevant nowadays   is the lack of a available software
infrastructures for the fast development of such technologies. 1chipML is a library which purpose
is to bridge this gap.

\section{1chipML in a nutshell}

In order to make a technology take off,        it is important to have a fast and reliable way to
develop (and evolve) it.      Without such infrastructure and tools, it is hard to imagine how to
develop something that can have a real impact on society.       In fact, the availability of such
infrastructure can become the very reason for the success (or failure) of an invention, no matter
what the field is. Obviously, this is valid for the fields of IoT and EC too.      At the time of
writing this manual, one quickly realizes (unfortunately) that such development         tools are
practically unavailable, especially if the goal is to run relatively sophisticated  algorithms on
MCUs such as number crunching and machine learning (ML) methods.        Of course, there are some
available libraries but they are either proprietary (or incomplete),  which is known to slow down
the development of technology      (a great example is provided by the GNU/Linux operating system
which has, eventually, allowed the development of the Android operating system).      The goal of
1chipML is to bridge this gap so that IoT and EC can become quickly mainstream.

The target of the 1chipML team of volunteers is to develop and maintain a library       which can
provide relevant computational capabilities on MCUs related to number crunching and ML.       For
example, one could need to run the Gauss elimination method to solve a relatively small system of
linear equations. The only option for now is to develop everything from scratch which can be time
consuming and error prone. With the 1chipML library, this problem is solved.  One simply needs to
download it and use it right away. A practical example is reported in a section below.

At the time of writing this manual,  there  are  relevant  main families of MCUs available on the
market such as the ones produced by ARM and AVR.  While,  in the past, these MCUs used to be very
limited (with very limited amount of memory and computational power), nowadays they have features
which allow to run relatively complex algorithms on such devices which used     to be practically
impossible previously. This is one of the reasons why 1chipML has been created.


\section{Development paradigms}

How to use 1chipML? There are essentially two ways:
\begin{itemize}
 \item It is possible to include the whole library into a code so that all methods implemented are available at once.
 \item It is possible to include only the algorithm that is needed. In this case, only the relevant methods are included.
\end{itemize}

A first practical example is discussed below.

\section{A first example}

\lstset{language=C}

The Gauss elimination method, also known as row reduction method, is an algorithm  to       solve
systems of linear equations. This method consists  of  a  sequence of operations performed on the
matrix of coefficients corresponding to the system at hand.         To perform the computation, a
sequence of elementary row operations which modifies the matrix until  the lower left-hand corner
of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible.

This method is available in the 1chipML library and it is very simple to use it.    The user does
not  need  to  implement anything related to number crunching beyond the definition of the linear
system itself.




\begin{lstlisting}
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>

#include "../src/1chipml.h"

int main(void){
 /* Variables and pointers declarations */
 int i;
 int N;
 gauss_real A[2][2];
 gauss_real B[2];
 gauss_real *sol; /* pointer towards the solution */

 /* The following parameters define a system of 2 linear equations A*X=B */
 N=2;
 A[0][0]=+1.; A[0][1]=+1.;
 A[1][0]=+1.; A[1][1]=-1.;
 B[0]=0.;
 B[1]=1.;

 /* Apply gauss elimination method to solve the system */
 sol=gauss_elimination(N,A,B);

 /* Print solution on screen */
 for(i=0;i<N;i++) printf("sol[%d] = %0.3f\n",i,sol[i]);
 return(0);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Numerical crunching}

This chapter introudces and discusses the various numerical methods that are already implemented in the current version of the library.
The Reader should bear in mind that this is still work in progress at the moment.

\section{Random number generators}

The generation of random numbers is a process used to create a sequence of numbers which cannot be reasonably predicted.
Two main methods are used to generate random numbers. In the first approach, one measures some physical phenomenon that
is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. For instance, sources of
randomness include measuring atmospheric noise, thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena.
In the second approach, one uses computational algorithms that can produce long sequences of apparently random results,
which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. This type of random
number generator is often called a pseudorandom number generator and it is the method used in the 1chipML library.

While a pseudorandom number generator based solely on deterministic logic can never be regarded as a true random number
source in the purest sense of the word, in practice they are generally sufficient even for demanding security-critical
applications. In fact, carefully designed and implemented pseudorandom number generators can be certified for security-critical
cryptographic purposes. Many computational methods exist for pseudorandom number generation. In the following we present two of these pseudorandom number generators.

\subsection{The linear congruential generator}

This method is implemented in the file "src/linear\_congruential\_random\_generator.c" of the library.

A linear congruential generator is an algorithm that yields a sequence of pseudo-randomized numbers computed
with a discontinuous piecewise linear equation. This method represents one of the oldest and best-known pseudorandom
number generator algorithms. The theory behind them is relatively easy and, consequently, allow a fast and easy implemention.

The main idea behind this generator is to use the following recursive relation:
$$
 X_{(n+1)} = (a X_n + c) \pmod m,
$$
where $X_{(n+1)}$ and $X_n$ are values in the sequence of pseudorandom numbers, and $X_0$ is called the seed or start value of the sequence.
The constants $a$, $c$ and $m$ are known as the multiplier, the increment and the modulus respectively with $m>0$, $0<a<m$ and $0 \le c<m$. In our particular
implementation of this method, the values for these constants are $a=1027$, $c=0$ and $m=1048576$. The initial seed $X_0$ is set to $38467$ by default. The user
can modify it by using the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}
 ISEED = some_value;
\end{lstlisting}

For clarity, an extract of the file "tests/test\_linear\_congruential\_random\_generator.c" is reported below:
\begin{lstlisting}
 /* Variables and pointers declarations */
 int i,n=100;

 printf("linear congruential random generator\n");
 for(i=0;i<n;i++) printf("%1.3f ",linear_congruential_random_generator());
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{The Mersenne twister}

Work in progress. This method is not implemented in the library yet.


\section{Systems of linear equations}

A system of linear equations is simply a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables.
The theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental part of linear algebra, a subject which is used in
most parts of modern mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of
numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics.
In the following we present the methods implemented in the library.

\subsection{The Gaussian elimination method}

This method is implemented in the file "src/gauss\_elimination.c" of the library.

The Gaussian elimination method, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm used to
solve systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of operations, i.e. row reductions, performed
on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute
the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. 

To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify
the matrix. There are three types of elementary row operations, i.e. {\sl{1)}} swapping two rows,
{\sl{2)}} multiplying a row by a nonzero number, and {\sl{3)}} adding a multiple of one row to another row.
Using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix, and in fact one
that is in row echelon form. Once all of the leading coefficients are equal to 1, and every column containing
a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form.
This final form is unique, i.e. it is independent of the sequence of row operations used, and it is this form
that is utilized to find the solutions of the system at hand.

To better understand how to use this method implemented in the library, an extract of the file "tests/test\_gauss\_elimination.c" is reported below:
\begin{lstlisting}
 /* Variables and pointers declarations */
 int i;
 int N;
 gauss_real A[2][2];
 gauss_real B[2];
 gauss_real *sol; /* pointer towards the solution */

 /* The following parameters define a system of 2 linear equations A*X=B */
 N=2;
 A[0][0]=+1.; A[0][1]=+1.;
 A[1][0]=+1.; A[1][1]=-1.;
 B[0]=0.;
 B[1]=1.;

 /* Apply gauss elimination method to solve the system */
 sol=gauss_elimination(N,A,B);

 /* Print solution on screen */
 for(i=0;i<N;i++) printf("sol[%d] = %0.3f\n",i,sol[i]);
 return(0);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{The LU decomposition method}

Work in progress. This method is not implemented in the library yet.

\section{Interpolation and extrapolation}

Work in progress.

\subsection{Polynomial-based approach}

Work in progress.

\subsection{Spline-based approach}

Work in progress.

\section{Optimization problems}

Work in progress.

\subsection{The gradient descent method}
The gradient descent method is an optimization algorithm to find a local minimum of a given function using it's gradient.

Many variations of the gradient descent algorithm exist, the simplest one probably being the steepest gradient descent method. However, this naive implementation of the algorithm tends to converge too slowly on the minimum as it approaches it using only right angle turns.

The variation implemented here is the conjugate gradient method, which seeks to reach the local minimum faster by approaching it using series of direction conjugate to the previous direction traveled.

Here is a pseudo-code of the algorithm optimizing $f(x)$:

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Conjugate Gradient Descent Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $x_{0} \gets \text{Initial guess point}$
    \State $g_{0} \gets -\nabla f(x)$ \Comment{g is the gradient vector}
    \State $h_{0} \gets g_{0}$ \Comment{h is the conjugate vector}
    \State $i \gets 0$
  \While{\texttt{$g_{i} \neq 0$}}  \Comment{Continue until the gradient is 0}
    \State $\lambda_{i} \gets \text{LineSearch(f, $x_{i}$, $h_{i}$)}$
    \State $x_{i+1} \gets x_{i} + \lambda_{i} h_{i}$
    \State $g_{i+1} \gets -\nabla f(x_{i+1})$
    \State $\gamma_{i} \gets \frac{(g_{i+1} - g_{i}) \cdot g_{i+1}}{g_{i} \cdot g_{i}}$ \Comment{Adjustment factor for the gradient}
    \State $h_{i+1} \gets g_{i+1} + \gamma_{i} h_{i}$
    \State $i \gets i + 1$
  \EndWhile
    \State \Return $x_{i}$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

At each iteration, the conjugate gradient descent algorithm travels to the minimum of the function in the direction of the current conjugate. It then computes the gradient at that new point. Using the previous and current gradient, we can calculate the adjustment factor to get the new conjugate. We then continue to the next iteration until we find a local minimum.

In order to find the minimum of the function in the direction of the conjugate we use a the line search strategy. 

We start by broadly bracketing the minimum between three points by using a succession of quadratic interpolation. 

Quadratic interpolation relies on the assumption that the minimum of a one dimensional function resembles a parabola. In order to approach this minimum, we can take three points on our function and move to the abscissa at the minimum the parabola passing by these 3 points. By applying this interpolation multiple times we can eventually arrive to a local minimum. 

Here is the formula for the interpolation using three points $f(a)$, $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ :
\begin{equation}
    x = b - \frac{1}{2} \frac{(b - a)^2(f(b) - f(c)) - (b - c)^2(f(b) - f(a))}{(b - a)(f(b) - f(c)) - (b - c)(f(b) - f(a))}
\end{equation}

Once the minimum is broadly bracketed by three points, we can use Brent's algorithm to find the exact abscissa and value of the minimum. This algorithm uses a combination of parabolic interpolation and golden section search to reach the minimum.

It is possible for the gradient descent method to not be able to find a minimum if for example such a minimum does not exist or the initial guess starting point provided does not allow to converge to a minimum. In order to differentiate between successful an unsuccessful descent, a status of either GRADIENT\_SUCCESS or GRADIENT\_ERROR is returned by the function.

\subsection{The genetic approach}

The genetic algorithm is a probabilistic global optimization metaheuristic. That means that it can be used to optimize solutions with many local optimums.
It does this by simulating the genetic evolution of a population. The algorithm consists of a sequence of operations that can be run continuously until a solution
presenting a sufficient accuracy has been created.


\begin{enumerate}
   \item The first step is to randomly initialize a population of solutions
   \item We then evaluate all of the solutions present in the population and the algorithm returns a solution if its fitness value is small enough
   \item Each set of parents for the next generation are chosen based off of a tourney approach (a fixed amount of solutions are randomly selected and the best two solutions are
   chosen to be parents)
   \item Each parent is then encoded into a table (Each parameter is condensed together to form a string)
   \item Two children are then created by a uniform crossover method between both encoded parents
   \item Each child then has a chance to have one value of its table mutated
   \item The two children are then decoded and added to the next generation
   \item Steps 3-7 are repeated until the next generation is the same size as the original generation
   \item The original generation is replaced by the new generation
   \item Steps 2-9 are repeated until a certain amount of generations has been created or a valid solution has been found.
   \item The best solution is returned
\end{enumerate}

There are many methods for selecting the parents. One of the most popular methods is the roulette wheel solution where a solutions chance of being chosen is decided by its fitness
divided by the sum of the fitnesses of the whole population. Another popular approach is the tournament selection where we randomly select a certain amount of solutions and pick the two
with the best fitness. There are also many crossover approaches. The one we have chosen is a uniform crossover that means that each character of the encoded parents has an equal chance
to be present in a child. The simplest approach is a one-point crossover in which an index is chosen for both parents and both encoded arrays representing the parents
are swapped around those points to create the children.


Genetic algorithms present a few problems such as premature convergence. This means that the algorithm can sometimes converge towards a point which is not the global
optimum. We have implemented a variant of the genetic algorithm called "elitist selection" in order to reduce the likelihood of this happening. This means that the best solutions from a population are directly transferred
to the next generations without undergoing any genetic operations. This algorithm is not guaranteed to find the global optimum but will generally head in the good direction. They can also consume a lot of memory in order to store all of the population
and the fitnesses which is why we have also developed a low-memory version of this algorithm where the fitnesses are not stored and are calculated each time they are needed.
This slows down the execution time but can let us initialize larger populations which could mean better solutions.





\section{Numerical derivation and integration}

Work in progress.

\subsection{First and second order finite differences approach}

Work in progress.

\subsection{The Monte Carlo approach}

The file "src/mc\_integration.c " describes the function of doing integration with Monte Carlo approach.
One can examine the expected value of an integral using the Monte Carlo approach. Traditionally, the
expected value of a function $g(x)$ can be calculated by first multiplying by its probability density function,
$f(x)$, and taking the integral over the desired region:
$$
 E [ g(x) ] = \int_a^b g(x) f(x) dx
$$
Alternatively, we can use a Monte Carlo approximation for the expected value by repeatedly
sampling a uniform distribution between the limits of integration.
$$
 E [ g(x) ] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)
$$
where $x_i \in [a, b]$. As noted, $x_i$  is a value that is sampled from a uniform distribution
between the limits $a$ and $b$ for each unique $n = 1,2,3,$ etc. This approach samples the $f(x)$
function and uses the law of large numbers to find a converged expected value.
As an aside, the multiplicative factor of $1/n$ is sometimes given as $1/(n-1)$ because there are
truly $n-1$ degrees of freedom with $n$-samples, but when $n$ is large enough the difference between
$1/n$ and $1/(n-1)$ is negligible.

Given the form of the estimator for the expected value, extending to the estimate of the integral is simple.
The expected value formula is multiplied by the range of the integration limits, as shown below.
$$
 F = (b-a) \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)
$$
where $x_i \in [a, b]$.

The file "src/mc\_std.c" describes how to calculate variance using the Monte Carlo approach. The variance of
the Monte Carlo integration scheme follows a traditional process of calculating variance around some random variable.
By continuing with the notation of taking the integral of a function $g(x)$, and the expected value of the integral being $E[g(x)]$,
the relationship for standard deviation can be given as:
$$
 \sigma_n = V \sqrt{\frac{E[g(x)^2] - E[g(x)]^2}{n-1}}.
$$
Here the additional $V$ term represents the total volume of the integration limits. If we were to evaluate a one-dimensional
integral between the limits of $a$ to $b$ then the equation could be written as:
$$
 \sigma_n = (b-a) \sqrt{\frac{E[g(x)^2] - E[g(x)]^2}{n-1}}.
$$
Using this format, we can easily calculate standard deviation or variance (standard deviation$^2$ = variance) along with the integration estimate.

The file "src/mc\_stratified\_sampling.c" is concerned with stratified sampling which is an approach to variance reduction
by which the integration volume is divided into subdomains that are each evaluated separately. The estimates from each
subdomain are then combined with a weight depending on their subdomain integration volume. Stratified sampling has the
benefit of always reducing the sample variance, without any prior knowledge of the function’s shape. Optimized stratified
sampling routines may recursively divide the function into regions with comparable values by grouping specific peaks or values.
Just as well, the naive approach of parsing the integration volume into uniformly large works without any prior knowledge of the function’s structure.
The stratified sampling estimate of an integral over a function $g(x)$ is given as:
$$
 E[g(x)] = \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{V_j}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} g(x_{ij})
$$
where $x_i \in V_j$.



\section{Eigenproblems}

Work in progress.
\subsection{The Jacobi method}

The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetrical matrix. \\

It works by applying multiple orthogonal similarity transformations to the original matrix. These transformations, called \textit{Jacobi} rotations are chosen so that, over time, the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements is minimized. The algorithm accumulates these transformations until the resulting matrix is diagonal. The product of all transformations gives then the eigenvectors of the matrix. \\

The algorithm starts by choosing an element to annihilate. To choose that algorithm, two variants are given in the library. First, the \textit{cyclic Jacobi method} chooses the elements in the order that they are given in the matrix starting with the first off diagonal element ($S_{0,1}$, $S_{0,2}$, ...). The other variant simply chooses the element that has the highest absolute value in the matrix. \\

Once the element $a_{pq}$ to annihilate is chosen, a rotation matrix $P_{pq}$ is then created using the following formulas :
\begin{align*}
    \tau &= \frac{a_{qq} - a_{pp}}{2a_{pq}} \\
    t &= -\tau +/- \sqrt{1 - \tau^2}
\end{align*}
Then, choosing the root with the biggest absolute value :
\begin{align*}
    c &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}}, \; \; s = ct \\
    P_{pq} &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & & & & & & \\
            & \ldots & & & & & \\
            & & c & \ldots & s & \\
            & & \vdots & 1 & \vdots & \\
            & & -s & \ldots & c & \\
            & & & & & \ldots & \\
            & & & & & & 1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Once the matrix $P_{pq}$ is computed, the element can be annihilated by multiplying $P_{pq}$ with the input matrix $A$. The algorithm is be described in the following pseudo-code where $A$ is the input matrix: \\

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Jacobi Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $V \gets \text{Identity Matrix}$
    \For{$i = 0; i \leq \text{numberOfIterations}; i++$}
        \State $p, q \gets \text{chooseElementToAnnihilate()}$ \Comment{Cyclic or classical method}
        \State $P_{pq} \gets \text{createRotationMatrix(p, q)}$
        \State $A \gets P_{pq}^{T} \cdot A \cdot P_{pq}$
        \State $V \gets V \cdot P_{pq}$
    \EndFor
    \Comment{V will contain the eigenvectors and A the eigenvalues}
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Multiple optimizations are made in the library to take into account the machine's precision. To do that, the concept of a \textit{sweep} is defined. Given a matrix of size $n$ x $n$, a \textit{sweep} is defined as $n (n - 1) / 2$ Jacobi rotations. To optimize the algorithm to skip useless rotations, in the first three sweeps, the rotation matrix is carried out only if :
\begin{align*}
    |a_{pq}| &> \frac{1}{5}\frac{\sum_{r<s}|a_{rs}|}{n^2}
\end{align*}
After that, the algorithm sets $a_{pq}$ to 0 if $|a_{pq}| < 10^{-(D+2)}|a_{pp}|$ and $|a_{pq}| < 10^{-(D+2)}|a_{qq}|$ where D is the machine's precision (number of decimal digits).

\subsection{The Lanczos method}

The lanczos method is an iterative algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetrical, sparse matrix.

The algorithm generates a sequence of orthonormal vectors, called the Lanczos basis, that form an approximation of the eigenvectors of the matrix. At each iteration, the algorithm computes values forming a tridiagonal matrix that is similar to the original matrix and has the same eigenvalues.

The basic idea behind the Lanczos algorithm is to generate an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by the approximate eigenvectors of the matrix and then use this basis to construct the tridiagonal matrix.

Here is a pseudo-code of the algorithm :

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Lanczos Algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $\text{$x_{0}$} \gets \text{Random unit vector}$
    \State $\beta_{0} \gets 0$
  \For{\texttt{i = 1; i $\le$ k; i++}} \Comment{k is the number of iterations}
    \State $\textit{v}_{i} \gets Ax_{i-1} - \beta_{i}\textit{v}_{i-1}$
    \State $\alpha_{i} \gets v_{i}^{T} \cdot x_{i-1}$
    \State $v_{i} \gets v_{i}/||v_{i}||$
    \State $x_{i} \gets v_{i}$
    \State $\beta_{i} \gets ||v_{i}||$
  \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

$$
T=
\begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha_{1} & \beta_{1} & \ldots & 0\\
  \beta_{1} & \alpha_{2} & \beta_{2} & \vdots \\
  \vdots & \beta_{2} &  \ddots & \beta_{k} \\
  0 & \ldots & \beta_{k} & \alpha_{k}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
V=
\begin{bmatrix}
  v_{0} & v_{1} & \ldots & v_{n} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The Lanczos algorithm is useful for solving large sparse eigenvalue problems since it generates a small, dense tridiagonal matrix that can be solved efficiently, rather than solving the entire matrix. It can also be used to compute a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, rather than all of them.

Due to the rounding error caused by the IEEE-754 standard, the Lanczos algorithm is vulnerable to numerical instability. When applying the algorithm, Lanczos bases tend to loose their orthogonality. To overcome this issue, the Gram-Schmidt algorithm is applied after every iteration to reorthogonalize the vectors $v_{i}$.

The Lanczos algorithm does not directly outputs the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors associated with the original matrix. Further steps are needed to compute those values. However, the Lanczos algorithm does help finding those values by providing a tridiagonal matrix T which is much easier to compute. 

  The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of T can be calculated using standard methods such as the Jacobi algorithm. 

  Once the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of T are known, the eigenvectors of the original matrix can be approximated by linear combinations of the Lanczos basis vectors. For example, given an eigenvector of T, say $\gamma$, corresponding eigenvector of the original matrix, say $\lambda$ is given by $\lambda = V\gamma$

\section{The Fast Fourier Transform}


The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete fourier transform (DFT) of a set of complex values. More specifically, the FFT is often used to convert a set of values from its original domain to a representation in the frequency domain.

The DFT equation can be seen in \ref{eqn:DFT}:
\begin{equation}
	X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \exp \biggl(- \frac{2 \pi i}{N} nk \biggr)
	\label{eqn:DFT}
\end{equation}
where N is the size of set of values, k ranges from 0 to $N-1$ and $i$ is the imaginary part. The equation shown in \ref{eqn:FFTTwiddle} represents the twiddle factor.
\begin{equation}
	\exp \biggl( - \frac{2 \pi i k}{N} \biggr)
	\label{eqn:FFTTwiddle}
\end{equation}

The Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm is used to find the FFT of a set of values. This algorithm uses a strategy similar to divide-and-conquer, allowing it to have a time complexity of O(n log n). \\

The algorithm is implemented in a function that takes in two separate arrays to represent complex values. The first array consists of real numbers, while the second array holds imaginary numbers. This algorithm overrides the arrays passed as arguments and replaces them for the result of the FFT. Furthermore, the radix-2 decimation-in-time (DIT) method was used, meaning the arrays must have a length equal to a power of 2. If this is not the case, an error code will be returned by the function. 

The first step of the algorithm is to execute bit-reversal permutation on the incoming arrays, as it uses the iterative approach. Then, the divide-and-conquer strategy starts. For the first set, the algorithm iterates over the elements that require the same twiddle factor. It then iterates over each group and uses the same twiddle factor for each one. After that, the twiddle factor is updated using the trigonometric recurrence formula and the next elements are selected. The same steps are repeated for the second set and so forth. By using this strategy, we end up with the result of the FFT.\\


Given the context of microcontrollers and their lack of memory, multiple design choices were made, which are summarized here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The FFT takes in two arrays of the same size (real and imaginary)
	\item The FFT only takes in arrays that have a length equal to a power of 2
	\item The FFT overrides the incoming arrays with the result
	\item The FFT returns 1 in case of an error, 0 otherwise
	\item The FFT has a space complexity of O(1) and a time complexity of O(nlogn)
	\item The FFT uses the iterative approach
	\item The FFT uses bit-reversal for the iterative approach
	\item The FFT does not calculate the twiddle factors in advance
	\item The FFT uses the trigonometric recurrence formula to reduce the number of sin and cos calculated
\end{itemize}
