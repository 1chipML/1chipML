# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides**. You can find them in the project repository. These are mainly located in the `doc/` directory but we suggest to also have a look at the various files in the repository. For example, the 'tests/' folder is good starting point if you need to explore the various ways you can use this library. The file 'CONTRIBUTING' is also another good starting point if you need to understand how to contribute to this project.

1. :memo: If the available documentation does not reply to your questions, you may **open an issue on GitHub** to ask for help. However, please explain what you are trying to achieve in clear terms, in other words help us to help you. For example, provide code samples, etc.

## What NOT to do

:x: Do not open duplicate of already existing issues.
