# Fast Sine and Fast Cosine

## Presentation

The prototypes allow for testing the accuracy and the acceleration of the sine and cosine functions.

## Requirements

1. An arduino board that supports serial communications
2. Arduino IDE

## Quick launch guide

Follow these steps for a quick launch:
1. Open one of the Arduino project folder ([fast_sincos_accuracy](./fast_sincos_accuracy) or [fast_sincos_performance](./fast_sincos_performance)) with Arduino IDE.
2. Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE. The default baud rate for the prototypes is `115200`
2. From Arduino `.ino` file, upload the project unto the Arduino board.
